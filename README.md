## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. I made a design from dribble inspired by - Mobile bank - App Design
Anastasia Golovko. Great Thanks to her. 

I Have used here following : 

 google_fonts: ^5.0.0
 auto_size_text: ^3.0.0
 blurrycontainer: ^1.0.2

Some more packages you will see but work with those packages is in progress. They haven't used right now completely. 
Soon i will update this UI with responsiveness for mobile, tablet and web.
